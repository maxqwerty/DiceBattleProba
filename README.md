# Dice Battle result Probability
Measurements of probability to win in DnD-style battle

## Rules
The most of d20-based systems uses next rule:
* throw d20 and add modificators to attack an attribute;
* throw d20 and add modificators to calc the defence;
* compare:
    *  if attack is more - attack wins
    * if attack is equal or less than defence - defence wins

This repository contains some scripts with logic to calculate probability for attacker to win against a defender with defined dice parameters.
